j-PEG: A PEG parsing framework for Java
=======================================

The *j-PEG* Java library takes as input a *Parsing Expression Grammar* (PEG) and constructs an
efficient *packrat parser* for it. The PEG can be either given in text form or constructed at
runtime via API calls.

**Note**: This repository will be filled soon.
